## To-Do List App with React-Hooks.

The easiest way to create an App React like this, is by creating a basic React template.

- [x] First, you have to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in its latest versions.

- [x] Then, a package manager, such as [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). It lets you take advantage of a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, and easily install or update them.

- [x] Now, create the React app. On your terminal, run the following command. This will create a new directory (my-app) inside the current folder or your selected folder.

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

... go into your newly generated directory (my-app)...

```bash
cd my-app
```

... and install additional facilities such as:

- [x] [React Hook Forms](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started/) library. 
React Hook Form is a library which helps you managing state and errors, fields validation, etc.

```bash
npm install react-hook-form
```

- [x] [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) library for the creation of id's


- [x] Finally, start up the React app run npm start to fire up your application. This should automatically open up an HTML page on your browser with your initial app.

```bash
npm start
```
